            <p>Will Russell Wilson stay, or will he go? In terms of football, amongst Seahawks fans there is no topic more important going into this offseason. I sincerley hope he returns, but our team has much to impove on if we want to be contenders again, and im just not sure Russ is intent on sticking around during this reload stage. He mentioned after our season ended that he wants to be a Seahawk for life, but that he wants to explore his options this offseason. I could be overreacting, but it sounds to me like "Im about to leave, but dont be mad at me". Either way, ill always be a Russell Wilson fan.</p>

          <h2>Bobby Wagner's Seahawk Future</h2>

              <p>Bobby is entering his final year under contract with the Seahawks. His status as the captain of our defense and a pillar of our organization could be cut short if the Seahawks decide to cut him this offseason. The Seahawks could save $16.5M against the cap next year if they do decide to cut him, but that would leave a gaping whole in the middle of our defense, and our organization. Bobby has stated since the end of our season that "In my mind, I don't feel like this is my last time. I don't feel like this is my last time putting on a Seahawks uniform". As a fan I sure hope to see him in a Hawks uniform next season, but only time will tell.</p>
