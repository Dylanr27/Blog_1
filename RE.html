      The Reach for the Moon Engine also know as the <b>RE</b> engine, is a game
      engine created by <b><em>Capcom&copy;</em></b> originally designed for
      Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. The game brought to our screens near life-like
      graphics with new graphical and rendering techniques such as Subsurface
      Scattering which is a shading method used to create highly realistic human
      skin. Developers managed to impliment these mechanics on systems such as
      the xbox one and the playstaion 4, which dont quite live up to current day
      hardware standards. With that in mind, what the new generation of consoles
      and hardware could have in store for gaming from a graphical standpoint
      leaves me incredibly excited for the future of gaming.

      Resident Evil 7: Biohazard was the first game to show off the impressive
      capabilites of the RE engine. It aloud Capcom&copy; developers to bring to
      life a horrific backwood enviroment thought only possible in movies. They
      accomplished this by taking advantage of the power of the RE engine with
      technology such as photogrammetry, which is used to scan real life actors
      and items to create life-like looking assets.

      Moving into the 8th generation of gaming, Capcom's RE engine is intended
      to be the successor to an engine they had been using for over 15 years by
      the name of MT-Framework. The MT-framework engine was noted as having many
      issues when it came to development. It was not easily modifiable and had
      slower development tools which posed an issue as development times
      continue to increase. <br /><br />The Reach for the moon engine is not a
      public engine, so it is difficult to say exactly what frameworks/languages
      are used in the making of the engine. Unity samples can be seen in the
      production video on the top left of this page, and it was stated by a
      developer working for Capcom&copy; with the RE engine, that it was quite
      difficult switching over to C#. Aside from those two things, not much
      information is available to the public.
