      Reach for the Moon Engine also know as the "RE" engine, is a game engine
      created by Capcom, originally designed for Resident Evil 7: Bio hazard.
      The game brought to our screens near life-like graphics with new graphical
      and rendering techniques such as Subsurface Scattering which is a shading
      method used to create highly realistic human skin. This mechanics were
      able to be implimented on systems such as the xbox one and the playstaion
      4, which dont quite live up to current day hardware standards. With that
      in mind, what the new generation of consoles and hardware could have in
      store for gaming from a graphical standpoint leaves me incredibly excited
      for the future of gaming.
