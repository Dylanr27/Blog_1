      Reach for the Moon Engine also know as the "RE" engine, is a game engine
      created by Capcom, originally designed for Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. The
      game brought to our screens near life-like graphics with new graphical and
      rendering techniques such as Subsurface Scattering which is a shading
      method used to create highly realistic human skin. Developers managed to
      impliment these mechanics on systems such as the xbox one and the
      playstaion 4, which dont quite live up to current day hardware standards.
      With that in mind, what the new generation of consoles and hardware could
      have in store for gaming from a graphical standpoint leaves me incredibly
      excited for the future of gaming.
