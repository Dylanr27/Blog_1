            <p>Well I was warned that Programming 3 was going to be challenging, and it has lived up to its reputation. Inheritence more than anything, is where i believe im still trying to fully grasp the concept. Trying to think of how to access all the information, what classes need to have a IS-A relationship with another class or what classes need to have a HAS-A relationship, needless to say its a complicated subject. While Programming 3 has had its moments where i wanna pull my hair out, I am confident i will fully understand the concepts after some more practice.</p>

            <p>Im developing a serious interest in the possibility of pursuing a front end career. I have a loooong way to go, but being introdcuded to the world of front end has opened my eyes to so many things I can create on a computer, and I am very much enjoying it. I got into the computer science program because I am a gamer and I love to learn about tech, and I've always wondered what my mind could create in that aspect. So far in this quarter I have learned a ton in regards to HTML and CSS, and I've managed to create this blog your reading now. I both hate and love this blog I've created, because I want to do so much more, but at the same time I'm loving the learning process and seeing my blog develop more and more as I continue to learn.</p>

          <h2>MATH-190 So Far...</h2>

            <p>Going into this quarter, haven not taken a math class since I was in high school(I'm now 25) I was quite nervous about what to expect and whether or not I would be able to be succeed in that class being so far removed from math. But I believe the programming classes I have been taking over the previous few quarters have sufficently prepared me for this math class becuase I have not had much trouble at all. I still have half the quarter to go, but thus far it has been smooth sailing.</p>
